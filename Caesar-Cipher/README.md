# Caesar-Cipher
The program encrypts and decrypts a user-inputed message using a Caesar cipher. The program asks the user for the number of keys and the value of each of those key values. These values are stored in two queues. Each character in the message is shifted by a different key value from the first queue. If the message is longer than the list of key values, we start using the key over again from the beginning. After the message is encrypted we decode it using the second queue. In this program we only consider the printable characters with the ASCII character numbers from 32 to 126.
